```
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the result by 4

# Initialize the sum
total_sum = 0

# Calculate the first 10,000 terms
for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # calculate the term 1/(2n + 1)
    if i % 2 == 0:          # if i is even, add the term
        total_sum += term
    else:                   # if i is odd, subtract the term
        total_sum -= term

# Multiply the total by 4
result = total_sum * 4

# Print the final result
print(result)

# Output:
# 3.1414926535900345
